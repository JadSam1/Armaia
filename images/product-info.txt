# Product Images for Shop Feature

To complete the shopping feature with product images, you need to add the following image:

## Required Image:

1. **Main Product Image (First Video)**
   - Filename: `product-1.jpg`
   - Description: Image of a summer dress
   - Recommended size: 600x800 pixels
   - Place in the `images` directory

## How it works:

When you click the "Shop" button on the first video, the product modal will display this image in the product details. This is configured in the JavaScript file where the `hasImage` property is set to `true` for the first product.

## Sample Image Sources:

You can use images from:
- Fashion e-commerce websites (for personal use only)
- Stock photo websites like Unsplash or Pexels
- Create your own product photos

## Placeholder:

If you don't add the image, the system will show a placeholder saying "Product image not available" for all products.
